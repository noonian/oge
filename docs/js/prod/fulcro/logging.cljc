(ns fulcro.logging
  "Utilities for logging on the client and server.

  This namespace exists so that fulcro libraries have a mechanism to do logging that can be lightweight without
  pull in any additional dependencies. You can use this logging support, but it is not designed to be great, just
  lightweight and efficient.

  It is highly recommended that you use a dedicated logging library in production apps, such as timbre. However, if
  you're writing an add-on for Fulcro it is probably best to use this logging so you give our users a consistent
  way to deal with Fulcro logging."
