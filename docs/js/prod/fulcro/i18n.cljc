;; This set of constructions probably looks pretty screwy. In order for xgettext to work right, it
;; must see `tr("hello")` in the output JS, but by default the compiler outputs a call(tr, args)
;; construction. By explicitly setting (and using) a Javascript function we don't have to
;; worry about compiler options for static calls.

;; The other thing we're doing is wrapping that in a macro. The macro serves two purposes: One
;; it makes better syntatic sugar than having to type `(js/tr ...)`, but the real consideration
;; is that we want `tr` to fail to compile if you use it with a variable. This is another important
;; consideration for ensuring that translations can be extracted. The `tr-unsafe` macro exists
;; for cases where you must have logic invoved, but lets you know that you must have some other
;; way of ensuring those translations make it into your final product.
